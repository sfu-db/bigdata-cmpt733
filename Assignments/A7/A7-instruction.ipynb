    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to give you some sense on how the S3 console and the Boto S3 API work. Please follow the following steps to finish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the NBA dataset to your local machine \n",
    "2. Create a bucket in your S3 using the S3 console (you can use any name for the bucket)\n",
    "3. Upload \"playbyplay20120510040.__zip__\" to the bucket   \n",
    "4. Create a new python notebook on your EC2 instance\n",
    "5. In the notebook, please write a piece of code that can use the [Boto 3 API](https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/migrations3.html) to do the followings:\n",
    "  - Retrieve \"playbyplay20120510040.zip\" from __S3__ to your local machine\n",
    "  - Extract the lines that contain the word of \"bryant\" (ignore case). You can use the [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/2/library/zipfile.html) library to read the zip file directly.\n",
    "  - Write the extracted lines to a local file named \"bryant.txt\"\n",
    "  - Upload \"bryant.txt\" to the bucket that you created \n",

    "__Hints:__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Please first install boto3 into your EC2 instance by running the following command:\n",
    "> conda install boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should never put *AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID* and *AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY* into your code. To avoid this, you can set them as system environment variables \n",
    "\n",
    "* Please take a look at the Boto 3 Transfer Manager [API](http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/s3.html#using-the-transfer-manager)\n",

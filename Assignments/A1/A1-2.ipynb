    "Many Websites (such as Twitter, Yelp, Spotify) provide free APIs to allow users to access their data. *API wrappers* simplify the use of these APIs by wrapping API calls into easy-to-use Python functions. At SFU, we are developing a unified API wrapper, called [DataPrep.Connector](https://github.com/sfu-db/dataprep#connector), which offers a unified programming interface to collect data from a variety of Web APIs.\n",

    "* How to ask insightful questions about data\n",
    "* How to collect data from Web APIs using DataPrep.Connector\n",

    "1. Please use [pandas.DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) rather than spark.DataFrame to manipulate data.\n",

    "2. Please follow the python code style (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If TA finds your code hard to read, you will lose points. This requirement will stay for the whole semester."

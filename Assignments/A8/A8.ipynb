In this assignment, we will cover two important topics in statistics: correlation analysis and hypothesis testing, where the former belongs to the descriptive part and the latter belongs to the inferential part. After this assignment, you will be able to answer the following questions:\n",

    "**Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "1. How to visualize the relationship between two variables?  \n",
    "2. What is Pearson's correlation? How to compute it?\n",

    "4. What's the difference between Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation? \n",

    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "1. Why A/B testing?  \n",
